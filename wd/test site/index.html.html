	<h2>The Wolf's wise words</h2>
	<p>The wolf will never lose sleep, worrying about the feelings of sheep. But no-one ever told the sheep, that they outnumber the wolves.</p>
	<p>Leave the pain behind and let your life be your own again. There is a place where all time is now, and the choices are simple and always your own. Wolves have no kings. </p>
	<p>The tiger and the lion may be more powerful but the wolf does not perform in the circus.</p> 
	<p> A wolf used as a </p>
	<ul>
		<li>spirit</li>
		<li>totem</li>

	</ul>
	<p>can help us harness our innermost wild nature to protect our emotional and physical well-being.</p>
